# Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is all about algorithms which are fed with (large quantities of) real-world data, and which return a compressed model' of the data. An example is the world model' of a robot: the input data are sensor data streams, from which the robot learns a model of its environment -- needed, for instance, for navigation. Another example is a spoken language model: the input data are speech recordings, from which ML methods build a model of spoken English -- useful, for instance, in automated speech recognition systems. There is a large number of formalisms in which such models can be cast, and an equally large diversity of learning algorithms. However, there is a relatively small number of fundamental challenges which are common to all of these formalisms and algorithms: most notably, the "curse of dimensionality'' and the almost deadly-dangerous problem of under- vs. overfitting. This lecture introduces such fundamental concepts and illustrates them with a choice of elementary model formalisms (linear classifiers and regressors, radial basis function networks, clustering, mixtures of Gaussians, Parzen windows). Furthermore, the course also provides a refresher of the requisite concepts from probability theory, statistics, and linear algebra.
