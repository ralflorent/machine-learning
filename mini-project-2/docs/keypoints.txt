ML, mini project 2 report

Key points to discuss:

- outline, task description, overview (on past related work) 

- brief description of key concepts: linear regression as classifier, MSE, bias-variance 

- explain code structure
	- A-Z procedure
	- Reusability of existing code (mini project one)
	- Optimization of k-means algorithm performance 
	- reference the imported packages

- Analysis and Results
	- describing results
	- choosing optimal alpha and K
		- why alpha = 0.0, K = 20
		- illustrate with table and figure

- conclusion

- outlook
	- things we could have tried:
		- PCA for feature extraction
		- Handwritten design 
	- expectations

- References

- appendix: python script (well-documented)
